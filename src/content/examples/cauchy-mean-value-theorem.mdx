# CauchyMeanValueTheorem

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Cauchy’s mean value theorem">
Let $f, g : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous as well as differentiable on $(a, b)$.  
Let further $g'(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$.  
Then $g(a) \neq g(b)$ and there exists a $\xi \in (a, b)$ such that

$$
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} = \frac{f'(\xi)}{g'(\xi)}.
$$
