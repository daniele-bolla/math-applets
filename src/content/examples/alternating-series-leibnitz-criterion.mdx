# Alternating series (Leibniz criterion)

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Leibniz criterion / alternating series test (Theorem 3.5)">
Let $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a monotonically decreasing null sequence (i.e. $a_{n+1}\le a_n$ and $a_n\to 0$).
Then the alternating series

$$

\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k a_k

$$
converges.

## How to use the applet (following the proof)
Move the slider `N` and watch the partial sums $s_n=\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k a_k$.

The even partial sums $s_{2m}$ (red) form a decreasing sequence, while the odd partial sums $s_{2m+1}$ (blue) form an increasing sequence. The dashed horizontal lines visualize the bounds

$$

s_{2m+1} \le s \le s_{2m}.

$$
The vertical “gap” segment shows

$$

s_{2m}-s_{2m+1}=a_{2m+1}\to 0,

$$
so the two bounding subsequences squeeze together and must converge to the same limit. Therefore $(s_n)$ converges and the series converges.

In this applet we use $a_n=\frac{1}{(n+1)^p}$ with $p>0$, which is decreasing and satisfies $a_n\to 0$.
