# Fundamental Theorem Of Calculs 

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="TFundamental theorem of calculus">
Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an interval, $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and $a \in I$. Then the following statements are satisfied:  

i) The function $F : I \to \mathbb{R}, \quad x \mapsto F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt$  is an antiderivative of $f$.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/FundamentalTheoremOfCalculs.tsx).

The applet visualizes the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (I)** following 
closely the structure of the standard proof.

Given a continuous function $f$, we define
$$
F(x) := \int_0^x f(t)\,dt,
$$
which represents the accumulated area under the graph of $f$ from $0$ to $x$.
The graph of $F$ is shown together with the graph of $f$.

To study the differentiability of $F$, two points $x$ and $x+h$ are selected on the $x$-axis.
The difference quotient
$$
\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}
$$
is visualized as the slope of the secant line of $F$ between these two points.

I am reusing part of the Mean value theorem for integrals, wich is used in the proof as 
well as visualizing the derivative  $F'(x) = f(x)$, as in the example Secant and Tangent line

In this applet, we choose a **strictly increasing and invertible** function.

```ts
// f(t) = 0.1 t^3 + 1
const f = (t: number) => 0.1 * t ** 3 + 1;

// Antiderivative F(x) = 0.025 x^4 + x
const F = (x: number) => 0.025 * x ** 4 + x;

// inverse of f
const fInverse = (y: number) => Math.cbrt(10 * (y - 1));
```
This additional structure allows the point $\xi_h$ to be computed explicitly as
$$
\xi_h = f^{-1}\!\left(\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}\right),
$$
without relying on numerical methods.
The point $\xi_h$ and the corresponding height $f(\xi_h)$ are displayed in the applet.

As $h$ becomes smaller, the interval $[x,x+h]$ shrinks and the point $\xi_h$ moves closer to $x$.
Consequently, the slope of the secant line converges to $f(x)$.
This visually illustrates the conclusion of the theorem:
$$
F'(x) = f(x).
$$
