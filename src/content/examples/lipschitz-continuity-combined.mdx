# Lipschitz Continuity

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Accumulation Point">

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a set and $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Then the following
statements are equivalent:
Let $D \subset \mathbb{R}$ and $f : D \to \mathbb{R}$.
The function $f$ is called **Lipschitz continuous** if there exists an $L > 0$
such that for all $x, y \in D$ it holds that
$|f(x) - f(y)| \le L\, |x - y|$.

This applet represents the standard geometric interpretation of Lipschitz continuity.

Given the condition that for an $L > 0$
$|f(x) - f(y)| \le L,|x - y|$

and that the slope of a linear function is “slope = vertical difference divided by horizontal difference,”
the slope of the secant connecting the points $f(x)$ and $f(y)$
has slope $\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x - y|}$. From the $L$-condition we retrieve
$\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x - y|} \le L$.

Thus the absolute slope is constrained between $\pm L$, as shown.

I am aware that this touches on the concept of slope, not yet covered by the student at this point, and that this connection is even better explained using the MVT.

As a simple example I chose $\sin$, whose derivative is $\cos$. By the MVT we get that
$\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} = \cos(z)$
for some $z$ between $x$ and $y$. But $|\cos(z)| \le 1 = L > 0$.
