# Complex Addition

<MathBlock type="definition" title="Complex Addition">
With the geometric interpretation of the addition of two complex numbers, in Remark 5.3
Item iii, clarifies the notion of the ``triangle inequality''.
In Figure 5.1, the length of the edges of the parallelogram in blue are given by $|z_1|$ and $|z_2|$,
whereas the length of the diagonal in red is given by $|z_1 + z_2|$.
Hence, as the figure shows, the triangle inequality says that the length of the two shortest edges
of a triangle is at least the length of the longest edge.

This applet visualizes addition of two complex numbers as vectors in the complex plane (horizontal axis $\mathrm{Re}(z)$, 
vertical axis $\mathrm{Im}(z)$) and illustrates the geometric idea behind the triangle inequality. 
The origin is the point $0$, and two draggable points represent the complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$.

The two complex numbers are represented by blue arrows from the origin 
to the draggable points (`board.create("arrow", [O, z1])` and `board.create("arrow", [O, z2])`). 
Their sum is represented by the red arrow from the origin to the point $z_3$, where $z_3$ is defined dynamically as
`z3 = (z1.X() + z2.X(), z1.Y() + z2.Y())`
in the code:
`const z3 = board.create("point", [() => z1.X() + z2.X(), () => z1.Y() + z2.Y()], ...)`.

To help students see the parallelogram (and hence the triangle inequality), 
the applet also draws two dashed light-azure translated arrows:
`z2 → z3` is a translated copy of $z_1$, and it is labeled `z₁`;
`z1 → z3` is a translated copy of $z_2$, and it is labeled `z₂`.
These auxiliary arrows make it clear that the diagonal of the parallelogram corresponds to $z_1+z_2$.
