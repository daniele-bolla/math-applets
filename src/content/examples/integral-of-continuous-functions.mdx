## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/IntegralOfContinuouFunctions.tsx).

This applet visualizes the standard proof that a continuous function 
$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is Riemann integrable by constructing two staircase 
functions $\psi\le f\le\varphi$ whose integrals differ by at most $\varepsilon$. 
The function is fixed in the code as `const f = (x: number) => 0.5 * Math.sin(x) * x + 2.5;`.

A good way to use the applet is the same order as the proof. 
First fix an interval $[a,b]$ by dragging the gliders `gliderA` and `gliderB`. 
Then choose an error tolerance $\varepsilon>0$ with `epsSlider`. 

The applet computes $\widetilde{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon/(2(b-a))$
via `const eTilde = eps / (2 * range);`. The dashed bracket at $x=b$ 
has vertical length $2 \widetilde{\varepsilon}$ (objects `epsBracket` and `epsBracketLabel`), 
and it is colored green/red together with the construction.

Next choose $n$ (the number of subintervals) with `nSlider`. 
The applet uses the uniform partition $Z: a=x_0<\dots<x_n=b$ with $x_k=a+k(b-a)/n$, implemented 
by `uniformPartition(a,b,n)`, where `dx=(b-a)/n` is the mesh size.

On each interval $(x_{i-1},x_i)$ the staircase functions are defined exactly as 
in the proof using the right endpoint $x_i$:
`upperH[i] = f(x_i) + eTilde;` and `lowerH[i] = f(x_i) - eTilde;`.
These are drawn as step graphs (`upperStep` for $\varphi$ in orange 
and `lowerStep` for $\psi$ in purple). The filled region between them (`bandPoly`) 
illustrates the intended inequality $\psi \le f \le \varphi$.

To make the $\delta$-step (7.2) explicit in a rigorous way, the code uses a 
Lipschitz bound derived from $f'(x)$. Since $f(x)=\tfrac12 x\sin x + 2.5$, 
we have $f'(x)=\tfrac12(\sin x + x\cos x)$ and therefore $|f'(x)|\le \tfrac12(1+|x|)$. 
Hence on $[a,b]$ we can take `supDf = 0.5 * (1 + max(|a|,|b|))` and define `delta = eTilde / supDf`. 
When `dx < δ` holds, condition (7.2) guarantees 
that for all $x\in(x_{i-1},x_i)$ we have $|f(x)-f(x_i)|<\widetilde{\varepsilon}$, 
which implies $\psi(x)\le f(x)\le\varphi(x)$ on each subinterval. 
The band (and the $\widetilde{\varepsilon}$-bracket) turns green when this 
condition is satisfied, and red when it is not guaranteed.
