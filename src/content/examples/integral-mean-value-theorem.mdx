# Mean Value Theorem For Integrals

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Mean Value Theorem For Integrals">
Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous.  
Then there exists a $\xi \in [a,b]$ such that

$$
\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)\, dx = f(\xi).
$$

## How to use
- Drag the blue points **$a$** and **$b$** along the $x$-axis to choose the interval.
- The **blue curve** is $f(x)$.
- The **blue shaded region** represents the area $\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\,dx$.
- The **red rectangle** has base $(b-a)$ and height $\overline f$ (the average value of $f$ on $[a,b]$).
- The blue point labeled **$f(\xi)$** is placed so that $f(\xi)=\overline f=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)\,dx.$
  A dashed vertical segment drops from $f(\xi)$ to the $x$-axis to help you read the corresponding $\xi$.
- The **gray dashed horizontal lines** labeled **$m$** and **$M$** indicate (an approximation of) 
the minimum and maximum of $f$ on $[a,b]$. They highlight the inequality $m \le \overline f \le M,$
which guarantees that the horizontal line $y=\overline f$ intersects the graph in the interval.
- Move $a$ and $b$ and watch how the blue shaded area $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ changes.
- Notice that the red rectangle adjusts its height so that its area matches the integral area.
- Track the point $f(\xi)$: it always lies on the graph *and* on the level $y=\overline f$, illustrating the existence of a mean value point.
- Try different interval lengths and positions: the average value $\overline f$ moves up/down, and the displayed $\xi$ shifts accordingly.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/IntegralMeanValueTheoremWithInvertibleFun.tsx).

*Reference*: Lecture Notes Calculus 1 ( May22,2022 ) Theorem7.9 page 132 and Figure 7.4 

The applet visualizes the **Mean Value Theorem for Integrals**. 

Geometrically, the theorem states that the area of the rectangle with width $(b-a)$ and 
height $f(\xi)$ (shown in red) 
is exactly equal to the area under the curve (the integral).

We use a **strictly invertible** cubic function. 

```typescript
// f(x) = 0.1x³ + 1
const f = (x: number) => 0.1 * Math.pow(x, 3) + 1;

// Antiderivative F(x) = 0.025x⁴ + x
const F = (x: number) => 0.025 * Math.pow(x, 4) + x;

// Analytical Inverse f⁻¹(y) = ∛(10 * (y - 1))
const fInverse = (y: number) => Math.cbrt(10 * (y - 1));
```
Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, 
we calculate the integral as $F(b) - F(a)$. 
We then find the mean value (height) $f(\xi)$ using the theorem: \
$$f(\xi) = \frac{F(b) - F(a)}{b - a}$$
```typescript
const meanValue = () => {
    const { start, end } = interval();
    if (Math.abs(end - start) < 1e-9) return f(start);
    return (F(end) - F(start)) / (end - start);
};
```
Since the function is invertible, we find the exact coordinate 
$\xi$ by applying the inverse function $f^{-1}$ to the calculated mean value. 
This allows the applet to update the point $f(\xi)$ 
without relying on numerical methods.

```typescript
const getXi = () => {
    const target = meanValue();
    return fInverse(target);
};
```
The $min$ anf $max$ of $f$, inside $[a,b]$, are displayed in gray. 
Since f(x) is strictly increasing, min is always at start, max is always at end
```typescript
const extrema = () => {
    const { start, end } = interval();
    return { 
    min: f(start), 
    max: f(end) 
    };
};
```
