# Lipschitz Continuity

<MathBlock type="definition" title="Lipschitz Continuity">
A function $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ is called Lipschitz continuous if there exists a constant $L \geq 0$ such that for all $x, y \in D$
$$|f(x) - f(y)| \leq L |x - y|$$

## Description

This applet visualizes the definition of Lipschitz continuity.

A function is Lipschitz continuous if the slope of the secant line between any two points on its graph is bounded by a constant `L`.

In the applet, you can:
- Move the points `x` and `y` along the graph of `f(x) = sin(x)`.
- Change the value of the Lipschitz constant `L` with the slider.

The two green lines starting from point `x` have slopes `L` and `-L`.
For `f` to be Lipschitz continuous with constant `L`, the graph of the function between `x` and `y` must lie between these two lines.
The derivative of `sin(x)` is `cos(x)`, and the maximum value of `|cos(x)|` is 1. Therefore, `sin(x)` is Lipschitz continuous with a Lipschitz constant of `L=1`. You can see that for `L=1` the condition is satisfied, while for `L<1` it is not.
