# Extreme Value Theorem (when it fails)

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Extreme Value Theorem">
Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous.  
Then $f$ has a maximum and a minimum, i.e., there exist $x_{\max} \in [a,b]$ and $x_{\min} \in [a,b]$ such that  
$
f(x_{\max}) = \max_{x \in [a,b]} f(x) = \sup f,
$
and
$
f(x_{\min}) = \min_{x \in [a,b]} f(x) = \inf f.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/ExtremeValueTheorem.tsx).

The applets shows why the closed interval domain and the continuity of the function
are necessary conditions.

In the first example, given the closed interval $[0, 4]$ i the function $ f(x)= -(x - 2) * (x - 2) + 3$.
The maximum of the function $(2,3)$ has been calculated manually.
Solving $f'(x) = -2x + 4 = 0$ the critical point is $x=2$. Morover the function result 
increasing before $x=2$ and decreasing afterwards 
since $f'(x) > 0$ on $[0,2)$ and $f'(x) < 0$ on $(2,4]$.

By removing the maximum point the function will be discontinuous, making the theremo impossible to hold.

In the second example i am using the simple (continuous) function $f(x) = x$ 
on the positive open interval $(1, 3)$.

Clearly the infimum and the supremum are linearly reached at $1$ and $3$ respectively.
Since this point are never reached due to openess, the theorem cannot hold.
