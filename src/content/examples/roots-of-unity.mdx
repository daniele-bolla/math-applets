# Roots of Unity

<MathBlock type="definition" title="Roots of unity">
For $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the *$n$-th roots of unity* are the complex solutions of
$z^n=1$.

They are given by
$z_k = e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{n}}$ for $k=0,\dots,n-1$.

Equivalently, these are the $n$ equally spaced points on the unit circle.

<MathBlock type="remark" title="Polygonal approximation of an arc (lecture note motivation)">
Let $x\in[0,2\pi]$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Define points on the unit circle by
$A_k := e^{i\frac{kx}{n}}$ for $k=0,\dots,n$.
Let $\ell_n$ be the length of the polygonal chain through $A_0,A_1,\dots,A_n$:
$\ell_n := \sum_{k=1}^n |A_k-A_{k-1}|$.

Then
$\ell_n = 2n\sin\!\big(\frac{x}{2n}\big)$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}\ell_n = x$.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/ComplexRootsOfUnity.tsx).

This applet visualizes the $n$-th roots of unity, i.e. the solutions of $z^n=1$. 
For a chosen integer $n$ (slider `nSlider`), the points
$z_k = e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{n}}$ for $k=0,\dots,n-1$
are displayed on the unit circle as equally spaced points, and the blue polygon connects them to emphasize 
that the roots of unity form a regular $n$-gon inscribed in the unit circle.

In the code, the roots are created as points on the unit circle with coordinates
$\big(\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{n}),\sin(\frac{2\pi k}{n})\big)$, using the expressions
`Math.cos((TAU * k) / n)` and `Math.sin((TAU * k) / n)` (with `TAU = 2 * Math.PI`). 
Concretely, the applet creates an array of points `roots` via:
`roots.push(board.create("point", [() => Math.cos((TAU * k) / Math.floor(nSlider.Value())), () => Math.sin((TAU * k) / Math.floor(nSlider.Value()))], ...))`.
This matches exactly $z_k=e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{n}}$.

To connect this with the formula $e^{ix}$, the slider `xSlider` moves the point $e^{ix}$ along the unit circle. 

A suggested way to use the applet (matching the lecture notes) is:
1. Fix a value of $n$ with the `nSlider`. 
Observe that the blue points divide the unit circle into $n$ equal angles of size $\frac{2\pi}{n}$.
2. Move `xSlider` and watch the point $e^{ix}$ travel along the circle. 
This shows that changing $x$ changes only the angle.
3. Compare $x$ with the special angles $\frac{2\pi k}{n}$. 
The applet highlights the closest root $z_k$, so you can visually identify which $k$ corresponds to the current position.
