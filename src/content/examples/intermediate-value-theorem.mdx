# Intermediate Value Theorem

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Intermediate Value Theorem">
Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous, and suppose that either 
$f(a) < c < f(b)$ or $f(a) > c > f(b)$. Then there exists an $x \in (a,b)$ such that $f(x) = c$.

### How to use the applet
- Drag the point **$a$** and **$b$** along the $x$-axis to change the interval $[a,b]$.
- Drag the point/slider **$c$** (the horizontal level) to choose the target value.
- The graph of $f$ on the chosen interval $[a,b]$.
- A horizontal line $y=c$.
- Intersection points between the graph and the line $y=c$ (up to a fixed maximum number), together with their projections onto the $x$-axis.
- If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and
$$

  \min\{f(a),f(b)\} < c < \max\{f(a),f(b)\},
  
$$
  then at least one intersection point appears with $x\in(a,b)$, meaning there exists $\xi\in(a,b)$ such that $f(\xi)=c$.
- By moving $c$, you can see that there may be **more than one** solution $\xi$.
- The applet also highlights the *image* $f([a,b])$:
  - **green segment** when the function is continuous on the chosen interval (no “gaps” in the values),
  - **orange warning segment** when the function is not continuous on the chosen interval (gaps can occur, and IVT can fail).

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/IntermediateValueTheorem.tsx).

This example illustrates how the **Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)** holds 
for continuous functions on a closed interval $[a,b]$.

By moving points $a$ and $b$, one can adjust the domain.

If the functions is continuous and $\min(f(a), f(b))< c < \max(f(a), f(b))$,
then there exists **at least one** $x \in (a,b)$ such that $f(x) = c$.
By moving the point $c$ in between the $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ one can
observe that there may be more than one such $x$.

To show these points i have created 3 (maximum roots of the function) **intersection points** with the lineC (parallel ot the x-axis) 
and graph.
```typescript
board.create('intersection', [graph, lineC, 1]...
```
I then make the intersections and their projections to the x-axis visible, only when $c$ is in between $f(a)$ 
and $f(b)$ (`isPointCinBetweenFaFb()`) 
and the projections lie on the interval $[a,b]$ (`isPointXCoordInIntervalAB()`)

A nice thing to notice is that, given continuity, the image of the function, over $[a,b]$, 
is again a closed interval (with no gaps).

The applets highligths the image of the function,
with a green segment when the function is continuous on the given domain and with a "warning" orange segment 
when the function is not continuous at the given domain and its image contains gaps.
