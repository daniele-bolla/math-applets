# Accumulation Point

<MathBlock type="definition" title="Accumulation Point of a Set">
Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $a$ is an
accumulation point of $A$ if, in every neighborhood of $a$, there exist
infinitely many $x \in A$.
</MathBlock>
<br/>
<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Accumulation Point">

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a set and $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Then the following
statements are equivalent:
    <ul>
        <li>The number $a$ is an accumulation point of $A$.</li>
        <li>There exists a sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $A \setminus \{a\}$ that converges to $a$.</li>
    </ul>

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/AccumulationPoint.tsx).

*Reference*: Lecture Notes Calculus 1 ( May22,2022 ) Definition 4.4 page 57 and Example4.7

This applet visualizes the connection between the definition of an accumulation point of set, 
and its characterization as being a limit point.

We consider a set $S = \{ \frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N}^* \} \subset \mathbb{R}$. 
The point $a=0 \in \mathbb{R}$ is an accumulation point of this set.
Trivially it is also a limit point of the sequence $( \frac{1}{n} )_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ wich is contained 
in $S \setminus \{0\}$

By moving the point `a` toward the limit point zero along the x-axis, the applet zooms in closer to zero 
and shrinks down the epsilon neighborhood of $a$.

When points in the sequence fall within the epsilon-neighborhood, the line representing them will turn green.
```ts
const isIntercepting = () => {
    const r = getRadius();
    if (p.X() === 0) return true;
    return sequencePoints.some(ps => ps.Dist(p) <= r);
};
...
createSegment(board, [
    [() => p.X() - getRadius(), 0],
    [() => p.X() + getRadius(), 0]
], {
    ...
}, () => isIntercepting() ? COLORS.green : COLORS.red);
```
The student should notice that, as one gets closer to zero, this happens more frequently 
and infinitely many times once at zero.

I am aware that this is not very intuitive and may need further refinement,
but I wanted to experiment with this idea.
