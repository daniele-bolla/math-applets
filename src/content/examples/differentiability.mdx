# Differentiability

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Best linear approximation of derivative at a point">
Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $f : D \to \mathbb{R}$, and let $x_0 \in D$ be an accumulation point of $D$.  
Then the following statements are equivalent:

i) The function $f$ is differentiable in $x_0$.

ii) There exists an $m \in \mathbb{R}$ and a function $R : D \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x \in D$ it holds that

$$
f(x) = f(x_0) + m \cdot (x - x_0) + R(x),
\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{R(x)}{x - x_0} = 0.
$$

If one of these conditions is fulfilled (and hence both of them), then the parameter $m$  
in Item ii) is uniquely determined and we have $m = f'(x_0)$.

<MathBlock type="definition" title="Tangent and Approx error">
The he tangent $t$ touching the graph
of $f$ at $x_0$ is given by:

$$
t : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad t(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)
$$

and can be interpreted as the *best linear approximation* of $f$ at $x_0$.

The *error* or *remainder* function we make when approximating $f$ by its tangent $t$ at $x_0$:

$$
R : D \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad x \mapsto R(x) := f(x) - t(x)
    = f(x) - f(x_0) - f'(x_0)(x - x_0).
$$

The error becomes “arbitrarily small” when $x$ is near $x_0$, i.e., $\lim_{x \to x_0} R(x) = 0$.
However, this condition can also be fulfilled by a “bad” linear approximation of $f$.
Therefore, it is more interesting to consider the *relative error*

$$
\frac{R(x)}{x - x_0}
$$

as a measure for the quality of a linear approximation, and to call a linear approximation
“good” if $\lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{R(x)}{x - x_0} = 0$.

### How to use the applet
- Drag the blue point **$x_0$** on the curve to choose the base point $P=(x_0,f(x_0))$.
- Move the slider **$m$** to choose the slope of a candidate linear approximation
$$

  L(x)=f(x_0)+m(x-x_0).
  
$$
- Drag the orange point **$x$** on the curve to choose a comparison point $Q=(x,f(x))$.
- The pink/green line is the linear function $L(x)$ through $P$ with slope $m$.
- The green dashed vertical segment labeled $R(x)$ shows the remainder (approximation error) at $x$:
$$

  R(x)=f(x)-L(x).
  
$$
- The faint gray dashed line is the secant through $P$ and $Q$ (visual aid).
- If $m$ is chosen close to the true derivative $f'(x_0)$, then $L(x)$ is a good local approximation near $x_0$, and $R(x)$ becomes small when $x$ is close to $x_0$.
- The applet highlights this situation by drawing $L(x)$ in **green** (and thicker) when $m$ is close to $f'(x_0)$.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/Differentiability.tsx)

This interactive applet illustrates when a linear approximation of a function at a point 
can be considered a “good” one.

The tangent line at $x_0$ is the best linear approximation of $f$ at that point.  
The theorem above states that if $f$ is differentiable at $x_0$, then  $f(x) = f(x_0) + m(x - x_0) + R(x)$,  
where the remainder term $R(x)$ satisfies $\lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{R(x)}{x - x_0} = 0$.  

A key insight is that the condition $R(x) \to 0$ alone does not guarantee a good approximation: 
even a poorly chosen linear function can have a remainder that vanishes in absolute terms. 
What matters is the behaviour of the *relative* remainder.

In the applet, the student can adjust the slope $m$ using a slider. 
When $m$ differs from $f'(x_0)$, the linear approximation is bad.
By dragging the point $x$ toward $x_0$, 
the sutudent can notice that, the remainder $R(x)$ approaches $0$ as $x \to x_0$, 
but the relative error $\frac{R(x)}{x - x_0}$ does not. 
When the chosen line coincides with the true tangent (i.e. $m = f'(x_0)$), 
it is highlighted in green, and both the absolute and relative remainders tend to zero as $x$ approaches $x_0$.
```typescript
    const isBestApprox = () => Math.abs(getM() - df(getX0())) < 0.2;
```

Thus the relative error is the difference of twp slopes: (Slope of Secant Line) - (Slope $m$)
$$

\frac{R(x)}{x - x_0} = \frac{f(x) -t(x)}{x - x_0} = \frac{f(x) -[f(x_0) +m(x -x_0)]}{x - x_0}
=  \frac{f(x) -f(x_0)}{x - x_0} - m

$$

The height of the purple line mantian this ratio, since start from the secant up to the linear approximation.
