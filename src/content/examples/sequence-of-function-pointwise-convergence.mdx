# SequenceOfFunctions

<MathBlock type="Definition" title="Pointwise convergence">
Let $K$ be an arbitrary set and $f_n : K \to \mathbb{C}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and
$f : K \to \mathbb{C}$.
 The sequence $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is called pointwise convergent
towards $f$, if for every $x \in K$ it holds that
$
\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = f(x),
$
i.e., for every $x \in K$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists an
$N_{x,\varepsilon} \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$
|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon \quad \text{for all } n \ge N_{x,\varepsilon}.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/SequenceOfFunctions.tsx).
This applet visualizes the sequence of functions

$$

f_n(x)=x^n \qquad (x\in[0,1]).

$$
The blue solid curve is the current function $f_n$. Faint dashed blue curves show earlier functions $x^k$ (only for $k<n$) to make the trend visible. The pointwise limit is drawn in red: the line $y=0$ (the “zero function”), together with the special point $(1,1)$, since $1^n=1$ for all $n$.

Two sliders are used: `n` selects the current index $n$ in $f_n(x)=x^n$, and `ε` selects the tolerance $\varepsilon>0$. A draggable point `x` chooses the evaluation point $x\in[0,1]$. The applet draws the horizontal $\varepsilon$-tube $f(x)\pm\varepsilon$ and highlights the point $(x,f_n(x))$. This point turns green exactly when

$$

|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon.

$$
The displayed value $N_{x,\varepsilon}$ is the first index after which the inequality holds at the chosen $x$ and $\varepsilon$.

In the code, the current graph is drawn with
```ts
board.create("functiongraph", [(x) => Math.pow(x, Math.floor(nSlider.Value())), 0, 1], ...);
```
The green/orange test uses the condition

```ts
const ok = Math.abs(fnx - fx) < eps;
```

First, increase $n$ and observe that for any fixed $x < 1$, the values $x^n$ drop toward $0$.  
Hence, the blue curve approaches the red zero function on $[0,1)$.

The behaviour at $x = 1$ is different:

$$
f_n(1) = 1 \quad \text{for all } n,
$$

which is why the limit includes the point $(1,1)$.

## Seeing the Definition in Action

Fix a value of $x$ and choose an $\varepsilon$.  
Now increase $n$ until the point

$$
(x, f_n(x))
$$

becomes green. This illustrates that there exists $N_{x,\varepsilon}$ such that for all  
$n \ge N_{x,\varepsilon}$, we have
$$
|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon.
$$

## Key Observation

Finally, move $x$ to a different value and repeat the procedure.  
You will typically need a different $N_{x,\varepsilon}$, and it may be much larger when $x$ is closer to $1$.

This is the key idea of pointwise convergence:

$$
N \text{ may depend on } x \text{ (and on } \varepsilon\text{).}
$$
