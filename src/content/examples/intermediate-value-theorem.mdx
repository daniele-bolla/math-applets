# Intermediate Value Theorem

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Intermediate Value Theorem">
Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous, and suppose that either 
$f(a) < c < f(b)$ or $f(a) > c > f(b)$. Then there exists an $x \in (a,b)$ such that $f(x) = c$.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/IntermediateValueTheorem.tsx).

This example illustrates how the **Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)** holds 
for continuous functions on a closed interval $[a,b]$.

By moving points $a$ and $b$, one can adjust the domain.

If the functions is continuous and $\min(f(a), f(b))< c < \max(f(a), f(b))$,
then there exists **at least one** an $x \in (a,b)$ such that $f(x) = c$.
By moving the point $c$ in between the $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ one can
observe that there may be more than one such $x$.

To show this points i have created 3 (maximum roots of the function) intersection points with the lineC (parallel ot the x-axis) 
and graph.
```typescript
board.create('intersection', [graph, lineC, 1]...
```
I then make the intersections and their projections to the x-axis visible, only when $c$ is in between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ (`isPointCinBetweenFaFb()`) 
and the projections lie on the interval $[a,b]$ (`isPointXCoordInIntervalAB()`)

A nice thing to notice is that, given continuity, the image of the function, over $[a,b]$, 
is again a closed interval (with no gaps).

The applets highligths the image of the function,
with a green segment when the function is continuous on the given domain and with a "warning" orange segment 
when the function is not continuous at the given domain and its image contains gaps.
