# Continuous functions are integrable proof

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Continuous functions are integrable proof">
Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous. Then $f$ is integrable.
</MathBlock>

### How to use
    - Visualize the proof idea: for every $\varepsilon>0$ we construct staircase functions $\psi$ and $\varphi$ such that
      $\psi \le f \le \varphi
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      I(\varphi)-I(\psi)=\varepsilon.$
    - The applet shows when the key “mesh-size condition” of the proof is satisfied.
    - Drag the blue points **$a$** and **$b$** to choose the interval $[a,b]$.
    - Use the slider **$\varepsilon$** to choose the tolerance.
    - Use the slider **$n$** to choose the number of subintervals in the uniform partition $Z$.
    - The **blue curve** is the continuous function $f$.
    - The partition $Z$ is uniform with mesh size
      $\Delta x=\frac{b-a}{n}.$
    - The applet computes
      $\tilde\varepsilon=\frac{\varepsilon}{2(b-a)}.$
      The vertical bracket at $x=b$ has height $2\tilde\varepsilon$.
    - The **orange staircase** is $\varphi$ (intended upper bound), defined on each open interval $(x_{i-1},x_i)$ by
      $\varphi(x)=f(x_i)+\tilde\varepsilon.$
    - The **purple staircase** is $\psi$ (intended lower bound), defined on each open interval $(x_{i-1},x_i)$ by
      $\psi(x)=f(x_i)-\tilde\varepsilon.$
    - The filled band between them is colored **green/red** depending on whether the proof’s size condition is satisfied.
    - The proof requires choosing $n$ so that $\Delta x < \delta$, where $\delta$ comes from uniform continuity (condition (7.2)).
    - In the applet, this is checked via a sufficient bound (using an estimate of $\sup|f'|$ for the fixed function $f$). 
    Concretely, it computes a number $\delta$ and checks whether
      $\frac{b-a}{n} < \delta.$
    - **If the applet shows the red message “$(b-a)/n \ge \delta$”, then the proof hypothesis is not satisfied.**
      - In this red case, $\psi$ and $\varphi$ are still drawn, but they are **not guaranteed** to satisfy $\psi \le f \le \varphi$ on every subinterval.
      - That is exactly why you sometimes see the purple staircase above the blue curve, or the orange staircase below it: the construction only becomes a true lower/upper bound after the mesh is fine enough.
    - **To make $\psi\le f\le\varphi$ hold, you need to reach the green state.** You can do that by:
      - increasing $n$ (smaller $\Delta x$),
      - shrinking the interval (smaller $b-a$),
      - or increasing $\varepsilon$ (larger $\tilde\varepsilon$, hence an easier condition).
    - Once the display turns **green**, the intended implication of (7.2) is in effect:$|x-x_i|<\delta \Rightarrow |f(x)-f(x_i)|<\tilde\varepsilon,$
      which gives $\psi(x)\le f(x)\le\varphi(x)$ on each $(x_{i-1},x_i)$, matching the proof idea.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/IntegralOfContinuouFunctions.tsx).

*Reference*: Lecture Notes Calculus 1 ( May22,2022 ) Theorem7.5 page 129

This applet is quiet experimental and visualizes the proof that a continuous function 
$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is Riemann integrable by constructing two staircase 
functions $\psi\le f\le\varphi$ whose integrals differ by at most $\varepsilon$. 
The function is fixed in the code as `const f = (x: number) => 0.5 * Math.sin(x) * x + 2.5;`.

A good way to use the applet is the same order as the proof. 
First fix an interval $[a,b]$ by dragging the gliders `gliderA` and `gliderB`. 
Then choose an error tolerance $\varepsilon>0$ with `epsSlider`. 
After selecting the  $\varepsilon>0$, thge student should decrease the interval or add more n-steps `nSlider`, 
to get condition 7.2 ($(b-a)/n < \delta$) works and therefore the all construction.

The applet computes $\widetilde{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon/(2(b-a))$
via `const eTilde = eps / (2 * range);`. The dashed bracket at $x=b$ 
has vertical length $2 \widetilde{\varepsilon}$ (objects `epsBracket` and `epsBracketLabel`), 
and it is colored green/red together with the construction.

Next choose $n$ (the number of subintervals) with `nSlider`. 
The applet creates the uniform partition $Z: a=x_0<\dots<x_n=b$ with $x_k=a+k(b-a)/n$, implemented 
by `uniformPartition(a,b,n)`, where `dx=(b-a)/n` is the mesh size, as in the proof.
```ts
const uniformPartition = (a: number, b: number, n: number) => {
    const dx = (b - a) / n;
    const cuts = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, (_, k) => a + k * dx);
    cuts[cuts.length - 1] = b;
    return { cuts, dx };
};
```

On each interval $(x_{i-1},x_i)$ the staircase functions are defined using the right endpoint $x_i$:
`upperH[i] = f(x_i) + eTilde;` and `lowerH[i] = f(x_i) - eTilde;` ( I haven't included codition 7.3: $\psi(x_i) = \varphi(x_i) = f(x_i)$).

These are drawn as step graphs (`upperStep` for $\varphi$ in orange 
and `lowerStep` for $\psi$ in purple). The filled region between them (`bandPoly`) 
illustrates the intended inequality $\psi \le f \le \varphi$.

To make the $\delta$-step (7.2) explicit, the code uses a 
Lipschitz bound derived from $f'(x)$. Since $f(x)=\tfrac12 x\sin x + 2.5$, 
we have $f'(x)=\tfrac12(\sin x + x\cos x)$ and therefore $|f'(x)|\le \tfrac12(1+|x|)$. 
Hence on $[a,b]$ we can take `supDf = 0.5 * (1 + max(|a|,|b|))` and define `delta = eTilde / supDf`. 
```ts
// δ ensuring (7.2)
const maxAbsX = Math.max(Math.abs(a), Math.abs(b));
const supDf = 0.5 * (1 + maxAbsX);
const delta = eTilde / supDf;
// dx < δ
deltaCopndition = dx < delta;
```
When `dx < δ` holds, condition (7.2) guarantees 
that for all $x\in(x_{i-1},x_i)$ we have $|f(x)-f(x_i)|<\widetilde{\varepsilon}$, 
which implies $\psi(x)\le f(x)\le\varphi(x)$ on each subinterval. 
The band (and the $\widetilde{\varepsilon}$-bracket) turns green when this 
condition is satisfied, and red when it is not guaranteed.
