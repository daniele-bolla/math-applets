# Taylor’s theorem

<MathBlock type="definition" title="Taylor polynomial, remainder term">
Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an interval, $x_0 \in I$, and $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ an $n$ times differentiable function.

i) The polynomial function $T_n : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad x \mapsto \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}\,(x - x_0)^k$
is called the *n-th Taylor polynomial* of $f$ in the expansion point $x_0$.

ii) The function $R_n : I \to \mathbb{R}, \; x \mapsto f(x) - T_n(x)$ is the *remainder term* corresponding to $T_n$.

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Taylor’s theorem">
Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an interval, $x_0 \in I$, and $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ an $n$ times differentiable function in $x_0$, where $n \ge 1$.  
Then the following statements hold:

i) *(Taylor’s formula)* For all $x \in I$, 
$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}\,(x - x_0)^k + R_n(x),$
where
$\lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{R_n(x)}{(x - x_0)^n} = 0.$

ii) *(Lagrange remainder)* If $f$ is even $(n+1)$ times differentiable, then for every $x \in I \setminus \{x_0\}$ there exists a  
$\xi$ between $x$ and $x_0$ such that
$
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}\,(x - x_0)^{n+1}.
$

### Example 1: $f(x)=e^x$ 
#### How to use 
    - Visualize Taylor’s formula for $f(x)=\sin(x)$ by comparing the function with its Taylor polynomial $T_n$ around a movable expansion point $x_0$.
    - See the remainder term at a chosen point $x$: $R_n(x)=f(x)-T_n(x).$
    - Drag the **blue** point **$x_0$** on the curve to choose the expansion point.
    - Move the slider **$n$** to select the degree of the Taylor polynomial $T_n$.
    - Drag the **orange** point **$x$** on the curve to choose where you evaluate the approximation.
    - The **blue curve** is $f(x)=\sin(x)$.
    - The **pink curve** is the Taylor polynomial $T_n(x)$ centered at $x_0$.
    - The **green vertical dashed segment** at the current $x$ is the remainder $R_n(x)$: its length is $|f(x)-T_n(x)|$.
    - The endpoints of the green segment are $(x,f(x))$ and $(x,T_n(x))$.
    - Fix $x_0$ and drag $x$ close to $x_0$: the green segment becomes small, illustrating that $T_n(x)$ approximates $f(x)$ well near the expansion point.
    - Keep $x_0$ fixed and increase $n$: the pink curve typically matches the blue curve better near $x_0$, and the remainder at the chosen $x$ usually decreases.
    - For a fixed degree $n$, move $x$ farther away from $x_0$: the remainder generally grows, showing that Taylor polynomials are **local** approximations.

### Example 2: $g(x)=x^5|x|$ 

#### How to use 
    - See that Taylor’s theorem needs enough differentiability at the expansion point.
    - For $g(x)=x^5|x|,$
      the function is $5$-times differentiable at $x_0=0$, but **not** $6$-times 
      differentiable at $x_0=0$. The applet shows what goes wrong when you try to use degree $n=6$ near $0$.
    - Drag the **blue** point **$x_0$** on the curve to choose the expansion point.
    - Move the slider **$n$** (allowed values $0,\dots,6$).
    - Drag the **orange** point **$x$** on the curve to choose where you evaluate the approximation.
    - The **blue curve** is $g(x)$.
    - The **pink curve** is the Taylor polynomial $T_n(x)$ around the chosen $x_0$ (only shown when the required derivatives exist).
    - The **green vertical dashed segment** at the current $x$ is the remainder $R_n(x)=g(x)-T_n(x)$ (its length is $|g(x)-T_n(x)|$).
    - If the Taylor polynomial is not defined (the “failure case”), the applet hides $T_n$ and $R_n$, and the graph of $g$ turns **red** as a warning.
    - First set $n=5$ and move $x_0$ close to $0$: the Taylor polynomial is still defined, and near $x_0$ the remainder segment tends to get small.
    - Now set $n=6$ and drag $x_0$ toward $0$:
      - as $x_0$ gets sufficiently close to $0$, the applet declares the Taylor polynomial **undefined** (pink curve and green remainder disappear, and $g$ turns red).
      - this corresponds to the fact that $g^{(6)}(0)$ does not exist, so the degree-6 Taylor polynomial at $x_0=0$ is not well-defined.
    - Even *before* the polynomial disappears, you can observe instability for $n=6$ when $x_0$ is near $0$:
      - keep $n=6$,
      - choose $x_0$ close to $0$,
      - move the evaluation point $x$ a bit away from $x_0$,
      - notice that the remainder segment $R_6(x)$ can become **very large**.

## Description
*Reference*: Lecture Notes Calculus 1 ( May22,2022 ) Definition6.6 and Theorem6.19 page 115


In both applets:
- Drag the **blue** point $x_0$ to choose the expansion point.
- Use the slider **$n$** to choose the Taylor degree.
- Drag the **orange** point $x$ to evaluate the approximation at a point.
- The vertical segment labelled **$R_n(x)$** visualizes the approximation error at the current $x$.

### Example 1: $f(x)=e^x$
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/TaylorTheoremSimple.tsx).

For the exponential function, all derivatives exist everywhere and satisfy
$$
f^{(k)}(x_0)=e^{x_0}.
$$
Hence the Taylor polynomial is well-defined for every degree $n$ and every expansion point $x_0$.

In the code, the Taylor polynomial is implemented as in the definition:

```ts
const T = (x: number) => {
  const x0 = getX0();
  const n = getN();
  let s = 0;
  const dx = x - x0;

  for (let k = 0; k <= n; k++) {
    s += (fDerivAt(k, x0) / factorial(k)) * Math.pow(dx, k);
  }
  return s;
};
```
The remainder is drawn as a vertical segment at the current x:
```ts
createSegment(board, [
  [() => getX(), () => f(getX())],
  [() => getX(), () => T(getX())],
], {
  name: "Rₙ(x)",
  dash: 2,
  strokeWidth: 4,
  withLabel: true,
}, COLORS.green);
```
### Example 2: $g(x)=x^5|x|$
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/TaylorTheoremSimple.tsx).

In this applet we use
$$
g(x)=x^5|x|.
$$
Equivalently,
$$
g(x)=\operatorname{sgn}(x)\,x^6,
$$
so it coincides with $x^6$ for $x>0$ and with $-x^6$ for $x<0$.

The $n$-th Taylor polynomial of a function $f$ at the expansion point $x_0$ is defined by

```ts
const T = (x: number) => {
  const x0 = getX0();
  const n = getN();
  const dx = x - x0;

  let s = 0;
  for (let k = 0; k <= n; k++) {
    const dk = gDerivAt(k, x0); // g^(k)(x0)
    s += (dk / factorial(k)) * Math.pow(dx, k);
  }
  return s;
};
```
For $x \neq 0$, since
$$
g(x) = \operatorname{sgn}(x)\, x^6,
$$
the function is a polynomial on each side of $0$.

At $x = 0$ we have
$$
g^{(k)}(0) = 0
\quad \text{for } k = 0,1,2,3,4,5,
$$
but the sixth derivative does not exist, because the left and right limits differ:
$$
\lim_{x \to 0^+} g^{(6)}(x) = 6! = 720,
\qquad
\lim_{x \to 0^-} g^{(6)}(x) = -6! = -720.
$$

Therefore, $g$ is five times differentiable at $0$, but not six times differentiable at $0$.

In the applet, this situation is handled by declaring the Taylor polynomial undefined
when $x_0$ is sufficiently close to $0$ and $n \ge 6$:

```ts
const EPS = 0.05;
const taylorIsDefined = () =>
  !(Math.abs(getX0()) < EPS && getN() >= 6);
```
The Taylor graph and the remainder segment are hidden whenever this condition fails:
```ts
const updateVisibility = () => {
  const v = taylorIsDefined();
  tGraph.setAttribute({ visible: v });
  rSeg.setAttribute({ visible: v });
};

board.on("update", updateVisibility);
updateVisibility();
```
To observe the failure, drag the blue point to $x_0 \approx 0$
and set the slider to $n = 6$.
The Taylor polynomial disappears because $g$ is not six times differentiable at $0$.
