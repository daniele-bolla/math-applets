# Secant Tangent and Derivative at a point 
<MathBlock type="definition" title="Derivative at a point">
Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $f : D \to \mathbb{R}$. The function $f$ is called differentiable in $x_0 \in D$, if $x_0$ is an accumulation point of $D$ and if the limit
$$f'(x_0) := \lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0}$$
exists. In this case, $f'(x_0)$ is called the derivative of $f$ in $x_0$.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/Tangent.tsx).

The example is an geometric interpretation of the derivative, specifically showing the connetcion between 
the slope of the secant between two points and the slope of the tangent at a point.
[Here a link where i took inspiration from](https://www.mit.edu/~hlb/StantonGrant/Lecture1/geomdfn.pdf).

The slope of the secant is given by:
```javascript
    () => `Secant: slope = ${((pointB.Y() - pointA.Y()) / (pointB.X() - pointA.X())).toFixed(3)}`
```

Meaning:
$$
\frac{ f(a+h) - f (a)}{(a+h) - a} = \frac{ f(a+h) - f (a)}{h} 
$$

Where `pointB = (a+h, f(a+h))`, and the value `h` is controlled by a slider.

When `h` approaches zero (the slider sets a minimum value of 0.001), the secant slope corresponds 
to the slope of the tangent at `pointA`, 
showing that the tangent line is the best approximation of a derivative at a point.

The tangent is calculated using the derivative of f since:
$$
\lim_{h \to 0}  \frac{ f(a+h) - f (a)}{h} =  f'(a)
$$
