This visualization provides a bridge between the algebraic and geometric interpretations of Lipschitz continuity.

The Lipschitz condition is defined as:
`|f(x) - f(y)| <= L * |x - y|`

This can be rewritten as:
`|f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y| <= L`

This shows that the **absolute slope of the secant line** between `x` and `y` must be bounded by the Lipschitz constant `L`.

In this applet:
- The **right-angled triangle** highlights the components of the secant slope:
    - The vertical side has length `|f(x) - f(y)|` (the "rise").
    - The horizontal side has length `|x - y|` (the "run").
- The **cone** originating from point `x` represents the geometric constraint. Its boundaries are defined by the slopes `+L` and `-L`.
- The condition is satisfied as long as the second point `y` (and the secant line connecting to it) stays within the cone. The color of the triangle and cone will change to reflect this.
