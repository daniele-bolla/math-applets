### How to use
- Visualize the proof idea: for every $\varepsilon>0$ we construct staircase functions $\psi$ and $\varphi$ such that
  $\psi \le f \le \varphi
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  I(\varphi)-I(\psi)=\varepsilon.$
- Drag the blue points **$a$** and **$b$** to choose the interval $[a,b]$.
- Use the slider **$\varepsilon$** to choose the tolerance.
- Use the slider **$n$** to choose the number of subintervals in the uniform partition $Z$.
- The **blue curve** is the continuous function $f$.
- The partition $Z$ is uniform with mesh size
  $\Delta x=\frac{b-a}{n}.$
- The applet computes
  $\tilde\varepsilon=\frac{\varepsilon}{2(b-a)}.$
  The vertical bracket at $x=b$ has height $2\tilde\varepsilon$.
- The **orange staircase** is $\varphi$ (intended upper bound), defined on each open interval $(x_{i-1},x_i)$ by
  $\varphi(x)=f(x_i)+\tilde\varepsilon.$
- The **purple staircase** is $\psi$ (intended lower bound), defined on each open interval $(x_{i-1},x_i)$ by
  $\psi(x)=f(x_i)-\tilde\varepsilon.$
- The filled band between them is colored **green/red** depending on whether the proof's size condition is satisfied.
- The proof requires choosing $n$ so that $\Delta x < \delta$, where $\delta$ comes from uniform continuity (condition (7.2)).
- In the applet, this is checked via a sufficient bound (using an estimate of $\sup|f'|$ for the fixed function $f$). 
  Concretely, it computes a number $\delta$ and checks whether
  $\frac{b-a}{n} < \delta.$
- When you change $\varepsilon$, $a$, or $b$, the $n$ slider automatically jumps to the minimum value required for the proof condition to hold (green state).
- You can manually drag the $n$ slider **below** the required minimum to see what happens when the proof condition fails:
  - Everything turns **red** (band, staircases, labels).
  - A warning message appears: "⚠️ Bounds fail: $\psi \not\le f$ or $f \not\le \varphi$".
  - You can visually observe the **blue curve escaping** the red band — the purple staircase may appear above $f$, or the orange staircase below $f$.
  - This demonstrates **why** the condition $(b-a)/n < \delta$ is necessary: without it, the construction does not produce valid bounds.
- **To restore the green (valid) state**, you can:
  - Increase $n$ (finer partition → smaller $\Delta x$),
  - Increase $\varepsilon$ (larger tolerance → easier condition),
  - Or shrink the interval $[a,b]$ (smaller range).
- Once the display turns **green**, the intended implication of (7.2) is in effect:
  $|x-x_i|<\delta \Rightarrow |f(x)-f(x_i)|<\tilde\varepsilon,$
  which gives $\psi(x)\le f(x)\le\varphi(x)$ on each $(x_{i-1},x_i)$, matching the proof idea.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/IntegralOfContinuouFunctions.tsx).

*Reference*: Lecture Notes Calculus 1 (May 22, 2022) Theorem 7.5 page 129

This applet is quite experimental and visualizes the proof that a continuous function 
$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is Riemann integrable by constructing two staircase 
functions $\psi\le f\le\varphi$ whose integrals differ by at most $\varepsilon$. 
The function is fixed in the code as `const f = (x: number) => 0.5 * Math.sin(x) * x + 2.5;`.

A good way to use the applet is the same order as the proof. 
First fix an interval $[a,b]$ by dragging the gliders `gliderA` and `gliderB`. 
Then choose an error tolerance $\varepsilon>0$ with `epsSlider`. 
After selecting the $\varepsilon>0$, the $n$ slider will auto-adjust to the minimum required value.
The student can then decrease $n$ manually to observe the failure case (red state),
or increase $n$ further to see the construction with a finer partition.

The applet computes $\widetilde{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon/(2(b-a))$
via `const eTilde = eps / (2 * range);`. The dashed bracket at $x=b$ 
has vertical length $2 \widetilde{\varepsilon}$ (objects `epsBracket` and `epsBracketLabel`), 
and it is colored green/red together with the construction.

Next choose $n$ (the number of subintervals) with `nSlider`. 
The applet creates the uniform partition $Z: a=x_0<\dots<x_n=b$ with $x_k=a+k(b-a)/n$, implemented 
by `uniformPartition(a,b,n)`, where `dx=(b-a)/n` is the mesh size, as in the proof.
```ts
const uniformPartition = (a: number, b: number, n: number) => {
    const dx = (b - a) / n;
    const cuts = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, (_, k) => a + k * dx);
    cuts[cuts.length - 1] = b;
    return { cuts, dx };
};
