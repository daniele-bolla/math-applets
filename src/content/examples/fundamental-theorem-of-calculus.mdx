# Fundamental Theorem Of Calculus 

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="TFundamental theorem of calculus">
Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an interval, $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and $a \in I$. Then the following statements are satisfied:  

i) The function $F : I \to \mathbb{R}, \quad x \mapsto F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt$  is an antiderivative of $f$.

### How to use
    - Visaulization of the first part of the proof
    - Drag the **green** point **$x$** on the $x$-axis.
    - Drag the **purple** point **$x+h$** on the $x$-axis (this changes both the size and the sign of $h$).
    - The **blue curve** is $f(t)$.
    - The **red curve** is $F(x)=\int_0^x f(t)\,dt$.
    - The **blue shaded area** represents $F(x)=\int_0^x f(t)\,dt$.
    - The **orange shaded area** represents
      $$
      \int_{x_L}^{x_R} f(t)\,dt = F(x_R)-F(x_L),
      $$
      i.e. the area “slice” between $x$ and $x+h$.
    - The **red points** $F(x)$ and $F(x+h)$ lie on the graph of $F$, and the line through them is the **secant line**.
      Its slope is the difference quotient $\dfrac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}$.
    - The **green rectangle** has base width $|h|=x_R-x_L$ and height
      $$
      \frac{F(x_R)-F(x_L)}{x_R-x_L},
      $$
      so its area matches the orange slice.
    - The **green point** $\xi_h$ (with the point $f(\xi_h)$ on the graph) is chosen so that
      $$
      f(\xi_h)=\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}.
      $$
    - First choose $x$, then move $x+h$ so that $h$ is not too small: compare the secant slope on $F$ with the height $f(\xi_h)$. They represent the same number.
    - Now drag $x+h$ closer to $x$ (so $|h|\to 0$):
      - the orange slice becomes thinner,
      - $\xi_h$ moves toward $x$,
      - the secant line becomes closer to the tangent line at $x$, tuiirning into a tangent line (colored in purple)
      - the slope $\dfrac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}$ approaches $f(x)$.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/FundamentalTheoremOfCalculus.tsx).

*Reference*: Lecture Notes Calculus 1 ( May22,2022 ) Theorem7.10 page 133

The applet visualizes the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (I)** following the proof.

Given a continuous function $f$, we define
$$
F(x) := \int_0^x f(t)\,dt,
$$
 (blue area).
The graph of $F$ is shown together with the graph of $f$.

To study the differentiability of $F$, two points $x$ and $x+h$ are selected on the $x$-axis.
The difference quotient
$$
\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}
$$
is visualized as the slope of the secant line of $F$ between these two points.

I am reusing part of the Mean value theorem for integrals, wich is used in the proof as 
well as visualizing the derivative  $F'(x) = f(x)$, as in the example Secant and Tangent.

In this applet, we choose a **strictly increasing and invertible** function.

```ts
// f(t) = 0.1 t^3 + 1
const f = (t: number) => 0.1 * t ** 3 + 1;

// Antiderivative F(x) = 0.025 x^4 + x
const F = (x: number) => 0.025 * x ** 4 + x;

// inverse of f
const fInverse = (y: number) => Math.cbrt(10 * (y - 1));
```
This additional structure allows the point $\xi_h$ to be computed explicitly as
$$
\xi_h = f^{-1}\!\left(\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}\right),
$$
without relying on numerical methods.
The point $\xi_h$ and the corresponding height $f(\xi_h)$ are displayed in the applet.

As $h$ becomes smaller, the interval $[x,x+h]$ shrinks and the point $\xi_h$ moves closer to $x$.
Consequently, the slope of the secant line converges to $f(x)$.
This visually illustrates the conclusion of the theorem:
$$
F'(x) = f(x).
$$
