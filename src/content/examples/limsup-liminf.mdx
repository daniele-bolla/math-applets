# LimSup LimInf 
<MathBlock type="definition" title="Definition of limit supperior and limit inferior">
Let $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a bounded sequence.

i) The *limit superior* of $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is defined by $\limsup_{n \to \infty} a_n= \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \sup_{n \ge k} a_n \right).$

ii) The *limit inferior* of $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is defined by $\liminf_{n \to \infty} a_n= \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \inf_{n \ge k} a_n \right).$

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Characterization of the limit superior">
Let $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a bounded sequence and let $a \in \mathbb{R}$.  
Then
$\limsup_{n \to \infty} a_n = a,$
if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ the following conditions are satisfied:

i) It holds that $a_n < a + \varepsilon$ for almost all (i.e., all except finitely many) $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

ii) It holds that $a_n > a - \varepsilon$ for infinitely many $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Description
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/LimSupLimInf.tsx).

For this example, I have selected the alternating sequence  
$a_n = (-1)^n \left( 10 + \frac{10 + 60\sin(0.8n)}{n} \right)$  
to provide a clear distinction between $\liminf$ and $\limsup$.

To clarify the first definition, the student can adjust the value of $k$ in  
$\sup_{n \ge k} a_n$ and $\inf_{n \ge k} a_n$ using the slider.  
The current values of $\sup_{n \ge k} a_n$ and $\inf_{n \ge k} a_n$  
are highlighted by circles with corresponding colors:  
red for the limsup and blue for the liminf.  
Both $\liminf$ and $\limsup$ are marked by dashed lines in their respective colors.

An illustration of the theorem is provided by allowing the student to move  
the corresponding $\epsilon$-slider for each of the limits.

For instance, in the case of the $\limsup$, the points below $a+\varepsilon$, 
are those finetely many $n$ to discharge and highlighted in orange, 
while the infinetely many points above $a - \varepsilon$ share the same limit color.
