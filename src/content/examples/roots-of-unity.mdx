# Roots of Unity

<MathBlock type="definition" title="Roots of unity">
For $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the *$n$-th roots of unity* are the complex solutions of
$z^n=1$.

They are given by
$z_k = e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{n}}$ for $k=0,\dots,n-1$.

Equivalently, these are the $n$ equally spaced points on the unit circle.
</MathBlock>

<MathBlock type="remark" title="Polygonal approximation of an arc (lecture note motivation)">
Let $x\in[0,2\pi]$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Define points on the unit circle by
$A_k := e^{i\frac{kx}{n}}$ for $k=0,\dots,n$.
Let $\ell_n$ be the length of the polygonal chain through $A_0,A_1,\dots,A_n$:
$\ell_n := \sum_{k=1}^n |A_k-A_{k-1}|$.

Then
$\ell_n = 2n\sin\!\big(\frac{x}{2n}\big)$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}\ell_n = x$.

### How to use the applet
- Move the slider **$n$** to choose how many roots of unity are displayed.
- The blue points are the $n$-th roots of unity
  
$$

  z_k = e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{n}}, \qquad k=0,\dots,n-1.
  
$$
- The blue polygon connects the points in order, showing that the roots form a **regular $n$-gon** inscribed in the unit circle.
- The roots are **equally spaced**: the angle between consecutive roots is $\frac{2\pi}{n}$.
- Increasing $n$ makes the polygon look closer and closer to the circle (this is the geometric idea behind approximating circular quantities by polygons).

## Description

This applet visualizes the $n$-th roots of unity, i.e. the solutions of $z^n=1$. 
For a chosen integer $n$ (slider `nSlider`), the points
$z_k = e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{n}}$ for $k=0,\dots,n-1$
are displayed on the unit circle as equally spaced points, and the blue polygon connects them to emphasize 
that the roots of unity form a regular $n$-gon inscribed in the unit circle.

In the code, the roots are created as points on the unit circle with coordinates
$\big(\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{n}),\sin(\frac{2\pi k}{n})\big)$, using the expressions
`Math.cos((TAU * k) / n)` and `Math.sin((TAU * k) / n)` (with `TAU = 2 * Math.PI`). 
Concretely, the applet creates an array of points `roots`.
```ts
        const roots: JXG.Point[] = [];
        for (let k = 0; k < MAX_N; k++) {
          roots.push(
            createPoint(
              board,
              [
                () => Math.cos((TAU * k) / Math.floor(nSlider.Value())),
                () => Math.sin((TAU * k) / Math.floor(nSlider.Value())),
              ],
              {
                ...
              },
              ...
            )
          );
        }
```
