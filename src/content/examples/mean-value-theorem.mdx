# Mean Value Theorem

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Mean Value Theorem">
    Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Then there exists a $c \in (a,b)$ such that 
    $$
    f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}.
    $$

## Description

To demonstrate the theorem i have selected a simple function $0.2*x^3+2$ with derivative $0.6x^2$.
```typescript
    const f = (x: number) => 0.2 * x * x * x + 2;
    //const fPrime = (x: number) => 0.6 * x * x;
```
Points a and b can be adjusted. The secant is just a line passing though f(a) and f(b).
To construct $c$ i solve the equation:
$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(a) - f(b)}{b-a} 
$$
Giving $c= \sqrt{\frac{f(a) - f(b)}{(b-a)*0.6}}$.
```typescript
    function findC(): number {
        const a = pointFA.X();
        const b = pointFB.X();
        const fa = pointFA.Y();
        const fb = pointFB.Y();
        const secantSlope = (fb - fa) / (b - a);
        const c = Math.sqrt(secantSlope / 0.6)
        return c
    }
```

Finally the tangent line (best approximation of $f'(c)$) has to be parallel to the secant.
```typescript
    board.create('parallel', [secant, pointC],...
```
