# Differentiability

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Best linear approximation of derivative at a point">
Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $f : D \to \mathbb{R}$, and let $x_0 \in D$ be an accumulation point of $D$.  
Then the following statements are equivalent:

i) The function $f$ is differentiable in $x_0$.

ii) There exists an $m \in \mathbb{R}$ and a function $R : D \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x \in D$ it holds that

$$
f(x) = f(x_0) + m \cdot (x - x_0) + R(x),
\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{R(x)}{x - x_0} = 0.
$$

If one of these conditions is fulfilled (and hence both of them), then the parameter $m$  
in Item ii) is uniquely determined and we have $m = f'(x_0)$.

<MathBlock type="definition" title="Tangent and Approx error">
The derivative $f'(x_0)$ does not only provide us with information about the slope of the
function $f$ at the point $x_0$, but also with a description of the tangent $t$ touching the graph
of $f$ at $x_0$. It is given by

$$
t : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad t(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)
$$

and can be interpreted as the *best linear approximation* of $f$ at $x_0$.

Let us analyze the error that we make when approximating $f$ by its tangent $t$ at $x_0$,
i.e., we consider the *error* or *remainder* function

$$
R : D \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad x \mapsto R(x) := f(x) - t(x)
    = f(x) - f(x_0) - f'(x_0)(x - x_0).
$$

The error becomes “arbitrarily small” when $x$ is near $x_0$, i.e., $\lim_{x \to x_0} R(x) = 0$.
However, this condition can also be fulfilled by a “bad” linear approximation of $f$.
Therefore, it is more interesting to consider the *relative error*

$$
\frac{R(x)}{x - x_0}
$$

as a measure for the quality of a linear approximation, and to call a linear approximation
“good” if $\lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{R(x)}{x - x_0} = 0$.
