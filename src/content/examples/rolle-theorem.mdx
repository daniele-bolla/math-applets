## Rolle's Theorem

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Rolle's Theorem">
Let $ f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R} $ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$.
If $f(a) = f(b)$ then there exists at least one $ \xi \in (a,b) $ such that $f'(\xi) = 0.$
</MathBlock>

### How to use the applet
- Drag the green point **$a$** along the $x$-axis to choose the left endpoint.
- The red point **$b$** is computed automatically so that $f(a)=f(b)$ (here $b=-a$), so the main hypothesis of Rolle’s theorem is always satisfied.
- The dashed vertical segments indicate the values $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.
- The purple points $\xi$ mark the critical points of the chosen function $f(x)=x^4-2x^2$, and a purple tangent is drawn there when $\xi\in(a,b)$.
- As you move $a$, the interval $(a,b)$ changes.
- Whenever at least one of the marked points $\xi$ lies strictly between $a$ and $b$, the tangent at that point is horizontal, illustrating $f'(\xi)=0$.
- For this function, the critical points are $\xi\in\{-1,0,1\}$ (since $f'(x)=4x(x^2-1)$), and the applet shows exactly which of them fall inside $(a,b)$.

## Description

The applet is an attempt to visualize the Rolle's theorem interactively.
The student drag points $a$ and $b$, to change the interval.

When the theorem conditions are met ($f(a) = f(b)$):
```ts
const eps = 0.1;

function rolleConditionHolds() {
    return Math.abs(f(pointA.X()) - f(pointB.X())) < eps;
}
```

The student can see horizontal tangent lines for each critical point $\xi$ inside the interval.
Using a symmetric function helps the student create this condition.

Morover the chosen function is simple to deal with for calculting its critical points.

Indeed $f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2$ with $f'(x)=4x^3 - 4x = 4x(x^2 -1)$.
Therefore $f'(x)=0$ for $x= 1, -1$ and $x=0$.

```ts
const xis = [-1, 0, 1];

xis.forEach((xi) => {

    const pointXiX = createPoint(
        board,
        [xi, 0],
        {
            name: `ξ`,
            visible: () => xiVisible(xi),
        },
        COLORS.purple
    );

    const pointXi = createPoint(
        board,
        [xi, f(xi)],
        {
            name: "f(ξ)",
            visible: () => xiVisible(xi),
        },
        COLORS.purple
    );
...

```
