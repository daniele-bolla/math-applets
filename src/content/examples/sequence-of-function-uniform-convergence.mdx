# UniformConvergence

<MathBlock type="Definition" title="Uniform convergence">
Let $K$ be an arbitrary set and $f_n : K \to \mathbb{C}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $f : K \to \mathbb{C}$.
The sequence $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is called **uniformly convergent** towards $f$, if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ 
there exists an $N_\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \ge N_\varepsilon$ and all $x \in K$ it holds that
$$
|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon \quad \text{for all } n \ge N_\varepsilon.
$$

This applet visualizes uniform convergence using the sequence of functions

$$

f_n(x)=\frac{\sin(nx)}{n}\qquad (x\in[0,2\pi]).

$$
The blue curve is $f_n$ and the red line is the limit function $f(x)=0$.

Two sliders are used: `n` selects the current index $n$ in $f_n(x)=\frac{\sin(nx)}{n}$, and `ε` selects the tolerance $\varepsilon>0$. 
A draggable point `x` chooses the evaluation point $x\in[0,2\pi]$. 

The point `x` as well as the limit and the `ε` tube turn green when:

```ts
const ok = Math.abs(fnx - fx) < eps;
```

By selecting an `n` and fixing an `ε` large enough, the student can observe that
$|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon$ holds for all x
by dragging the point `x`, so that `n` depends only on `ε`.
