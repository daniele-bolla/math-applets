# Cauchy’s mean value theorem

<MathBlock type="theorem" title="Cauchy’s mean value theorem">
Let $f, g : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous as well as differentiable on $(a, b)$.  
Let further $g'(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$.  
Then $g(a) \neq g(b)$ and there exists a $\xi \in (a, b)$ such that

$$
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} = \frac{f'(\xi)}{g'(\xi)}.
$$

## Description
*Reference*: Lecture Notes Calculus 1 ( May22,2022 ) Lemma6.15 page 109
The applet are an attempt to show the Cauchy’s mean value theorem.

### Example 1
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/CauchyMeanValueTheorem.tsx).

This example is taken from this [Math StackExchange answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4932567/608368).

The argument is not exactly the same as the proof used in the lecture notes, 
but it is very closea and provides a nice geometric interpretation.

Given an interval $[a,b]$, the applet displays the functions $f(x)$, $r\,g(x)$, and

$$

h(x)=f(x)-r\,g(x),
\qquad
r=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.

$$

The choice of $r$ is designed so that the endpoints match:

$$

h(a)=h(b).

$$
Therefore, by Rolle’s Theorem, there exists $\xi\in(a,b)$ such that

$$

h'(\xi)=0.

$$

Since $r$ is constant once $a$ and $b$ are fixed, the derivative is

$$

h'(x)=f'(x)-r\,g'(x),

$$
computed analytically as a combination of $f'$ and $g'$.
```ts
const getR = () => {
    const a = getA();
    const b = getB();
    const denom = g(b) - g(a);
    if (Math.abs(denom) < 1e-10) return NaN;
    return (f(b) - f(a)) / denom;
};

// h'(x) = f'(x) - r g'(x)
const dh = (x: number) => df(x) - getR() * dg(x);
```

After fixing $a$ and $b$, the student can move the point $\xi$ along the interval and try to satisfy the condition $h'(\xi)\approx 0$.  
When this happens, the applet highlights the geometric meaning of the theorem: 
at $x=\xi$ the tangents to $f$ and $r\,g$ have the same slope, which corresponds to the CMVT conclusion

$$

\frac{f'(\xi)}{g'(\xi)}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.

$$
### Example 2
[Link to code](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/math-applets/blob/main/src/components/applets/CauchyMVTParametricCurve.tsx).
This applet visualizes **Cauchy’s Mean Value Theorem (CMVT)** through a geometric interpretation in the $(g,f)$-plane.

Instead of drawing the graphs of $f$ and $g$ in the usual $(x,y)$-plane, we consider the **parametric curve**

$$

\gamma(t) = (g(t),\, f(t)).

$$
```ts      
const curve = board.create(
  "curve",
  [(t: number) => g(t), (t: number) => f(t), xmin, xmax],
  { strokeColor: COLORS.blue, strokeWidth: 4 }
) as JXG.Curve;
```

We choose a particularly simple function

$$

g(t)=t,

$$
so that:
- $g'(t)=1\neq 0$ everywhere),
- $g^{-1}(u)=u$ is known explicitly,
- the parameter $t$ is exactly the x–coordinate of the point on the curve.

Two movable points $ (g(a),f(a))$ (green) and $(g(b),f(b))$ (red).
The applet draws the **secant line** through $(g(a),f(a))$ and $(g(b),f(b))$. 

In this applet we take:

$$

f(t)=0.3t^3-t,\qquad f'(t)=0.9t^2-1,

$$

$$

g(t)=t,\qquad g'(t)=1.

$$

Let

$$

dF=f(b)-f(a),\qquad dG=g(b)-g(a)=b-a.

$$
Then

$$

h'(t)=dF\cdot g'(t)-dG\cdot f'(t)
     =dF - dG(0.9t^2-1).

$$
Expand:

$$

h'(t)=dF - 0.9dG\,t^2 + dG
     =(dF+dG) - 0.9dG\,t^2.

$$
To find $\xi$, we solve $h'(t)=0$:

$$

(dF+dG) - 0.9dG\,t^2=0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
t^2=\frac{dF+dG}{0.9\,dG}.

$$

This is why in the code `findXi()` computes:
- the interval endpoints in parameter space:
  - `left = min(a,b)`, `right = max(a,b)`
- `dF = f(right) - f(left)`
- `dG = right - left`
- then
  
$$

  t2 = \frac{dF+dG}{0.9\,dG}
  
$$
  as `t2 = (dF + dG) / (0.9 * dG)`.

Since $t^2=t2$, the candidates are

$$

t = +\sqrt{t2}\quad\text{and}\quad t = -\sqrt{t2}.

$$
The code then:
1. discards the case $t2<0$ (no real square root; numerically this can occur for some endpoint choices),
2. checks which candidate lies inside `left`, `right`,
3. returns that one (if both are inside, it picks the one closer to the midpoint).

Finally the tangnet at $\xi$ should be parallel to the secant:

```ts
// Secant line AB
const secant = board.create("line", [A, B], {
  strokeColor: COLORS.orange,
  strokeWidth: 3,
}) as JXG.Line;

// ξ point on the parametric curve
const Xi = board.create(
  "point",
  [() => g(findXi()), () => f(findXi())],
  { name: "", size: 5, fixed: true, strokeColor: COLORS.purple, fillColor: COLORS.purple }
) as JXG.Point;

board.create("parallel", [secant, Xi], {
  strokeColor: COLORS.purple,
  strokeWidth: 3,
});
```
