# Secant Tangent and Derivative at a point

## Description

The example is an geometric interpretation of the derivative, specifically showing the connetcion between 
the slope of the secant between two points and the slope of a tangent point.
[Here a link where i took inspiration from](https://www.mit.edu/~hlb/StantonGrant/Lecture1/geomdfn.pdf).

The slope of the secant is given by:
```javascript
    () => `Secant: slope = ${((pointB.Y() - pointA.Y()) / (pointB.X() - pointA.X())).toFixed(3)}`
```

Meaning:
$$
\frac{ f(a+h) - f (a)}{(a+h) - a} = \frac{ f(a+h) - f (a)}{h} 
$$

Where `pointB = (a+h, f(a+h))`, and the value `h` is controlled by a slider.

When `h` approach zero (the slider sets a minimum value of 0.001), the secant slope corresponds 
to the slope of the tangfent at pointA, 
showing that the tangent line is the best approximation of a derivative at a point.

The tangent is calculated using the derivative of f since:
$$
\lim_{h \to 0}  \frac{ f(a+h) - f (a)}{h} =  f'(a)
$$
